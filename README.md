# 🎮 Simon Game (Memory Challenge)

A web-based implementation of the classic **Simon memory game**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Test your memory skills by repeating an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds.  
The game gets harder as the sequence grows — how far can you go? 🚀

## 📌 Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Watch the color sequence and repeat it correctly.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Sequence length increases after each successful round.
- **Sound Effects**: Each button has its own tone for easy memorization.
- **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile.
- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript**: No external libraries required.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** – Structure of the game
- **CSS** – Styling and animations
- **JavaScript** – Game logic, event handling, and sequence generation

## 🎯 How to Play

2. **Watch the Sequence** – The game shows a sequence of colored buttons.
3. **Repeat the Sequence** – Click the buttons in the same order.
